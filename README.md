# Sum-of-Exponentials-Approximation
This repository records both the weights and exponents of the SOE produced by the [VPMR](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-022-01999-1), a recently developed sum-of-exponentials method.

##  Gaussian kernel  ##


##  Remark  ##
If you use these SOE in your work and feel that these approximations are helpful to you, please cite the following paperï¼š
