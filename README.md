# Sum-of-Exponentials-Approximation
This repository records both the weights and exponents of the SOE produced by the [VPMR](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-022-01999-1), a recently developed sum-of-exponentials method.

##  Gaussian kernel  ##
Exponents and weights of the SOE for the Gaussian kernel  $f(x)=e^{-\frac{x^2}{4}}$  with the number of terms $P=9$ and absolute error $10^{-8}$.

Exponents and weights of the SOE for the Gaussian kernel  $f(x)=e^{-\frac{x^2}{4}}$  with the number of terms $P=16$ and absolute error $6\times 10^{-14}$.
